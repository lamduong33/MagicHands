Supervised Learning approach:

Use a randomized decision forest:
	Binary classification on each pixel (hand or not hand)
Train CNN by recognizing joint locations
Infer joint angles from the image of the hand

Randomized Decision Forest Hand Detection:
	- Hand or not
	- Why: RDF is really good with full decision tracking
	- 25 depth and 4 trees
